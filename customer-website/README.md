# Customer Website

This project implements a customer-facing product catalog website for a grocery store.  
Customers can browse products and filter them by category using a web interface.  

The system consists of a frontend web page and a backend server that exposes APIs for product and category data.  
The application will be deployed on AWS using Terraform-managed infrastructure.
